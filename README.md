= Benefits of Publishing a Hosted Status Page =

If your organization is a solution provider, you understand that downtime can reduce customer confidence and impair your reputation. Hopefully, you can keep downtime to a minimum, but if you do have service outages, it's imperative that you provide your users with access to real-time status updates. 

Knowing your own service status is the first step and there are plenty of excellent monitoring tools like munin, statsd, graphite, and services like [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/), [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) and others that can assist with your internal service status tracking.

30suns completes the monitoring and reporting loop by providing your users with a centralized service health dashboard similar to the status pages that many professional platform and service providers publish, e.g., [Amazon Web Services](http://status.aws.amazon.com/), [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/appsstatus) and [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/support/service-dashboard/).

Publishing a status page will improve communication with your users and can even result in fewer support requests during outages.
